# Watermarkit Privacy Policy

Welcome to the Watermarkit app for Android!

This is an app developed by myself, Justin. The app is currently available on google play

As an android user, I want to make sure anyone that uses my apps knows that I fully understand how important privacy and personal information is.

I hereby state, to the best of my knowledge and belief, that I have not programmed this app to collect any personally identifiable information. All data (photos and text) created by the you (the user) is stored on your device only, and can be simply erased by clearing the app's data, uninstalling the app, and by creating any image exports that you've done.

I currently use ads for this app to help pay for maintenance and infrastructure.  The app may ask for permission to collect personal data to show personlized ads.  If at any point you want to reset your choices, try clearing your cache and deleting the storage for the app.

I made sure to double check the android permissions required to work Watermarkit and remove any that I didn't feel was neccessary.

Below are the permissions requested and their use:

|Permission                             | Use of Permission|
|---------------------------------------|----------------|
|android.permission.ACCESS_MEDIA_LOCATION |Access photos or images that may receive a watermark                                                                     |
|android.permission.INTERNET              |Used to pull news from development, icons for watermarking, and fonts                                                    |
|android.permission.READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE |Allow user to choose more images, also for a local database to keep user access (watching an add grants more temporarily)|
|android.permission.SYSTEM_ALERT_WINDOW   |Alert you when you're in the middle of adding watermarks but navigate to another screen without exporting                |
|android.permission.VIBRATE               |Notification usage in the future                                                                                         |
|android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE|Allows the user to save the newly watermarked image/photo.                                                               |

If you come across any issue, bug, or vulnerability, I would love to hear about it so we can get it fixed!

Thanks for trying Watermarkit!
sincerely,
Justin
