# Watermarkit Privacy Policy

Welcome to the watermarkit app for Android!

This is an app developed by myself, Justin. The app is currently available on google play.

As an android user, I want to make sure that anyone who uses watermarkit knows that I fully understand how important privacy and personal information is.

I currently use ads in watermarkit to help pay for maintenance and infrastructure (tools to build the app).  Watermarkit may ask for permission to collect and share data to show personlized ads.  Although watermarkit is completely free, and will be forever, a user may watch an ad when using of one of the features to get more options or selections for customization.  Reward ads are completely optional as we still provide some customization options for watermarking your photos.  Banner ads are optional for EU inhabitants when they fill out the data collection form.  For anyone not in the EU, the way not to see the banner ads would be to not use watermarkit.  I completely understand if a user makes that selection.  I understand how frustrating ads can be but I want to make sure I can keep improving on watermarkit while keeping it free for everyone.

The data points collected and shared for advertising, analytics, and fraud prevention purposes are:

IP Address

Diagnostic Information

Interaction with the app

Advertising ID

The advertising ID is a unique, user-resettable ID for advertising, provided by Google Play services.  If you want any data that was collected and associated with your advertising ID deleted, you can go into the Google submenu under settings on your android phone, select Ads, and delete or reset it there.

Although I can't speak for the ad network, I want to be transparent and provide some explanation from my perspective on why the other datapoints may be used:

Interactions with the app may include launching it or touching it.  Usually keeping track of launching the app will help developers know when to "fire" off certain things like populating things on the screen.

Diagnostic information may include crash logs, app launch time, hang time and energy usage.  These may be used to generate reports to see watermarkit's performance ( or lack thereof).

The IP Address collected doesn't give a precise location of you, the user.  Just a general location.  Anyone that uses the internet has an IP address and they're used when navigating or "communicating" with a network.  It can also be a good way to prevnt fraud.

If I come accross any other use of the previously mentioned datapoints, I'll update this policy ASAP so you're kept in the loop.

If you want to delete any of the data stored locally you can just clear the cache and storage of watermarkit.  Then uninstall the app and any exported photos/images you've made.  For EU users, once you clear the storage and cache, you can reopen the app to revoke any selections you've made on data collection and sharing before (in relation to watermarkit and the data it collects for showing personalized ads).

I made sure to double check the android permissions required to work Watermarkit and I removed any that I felt unneccessary.

Below are the permissions requested and their use:

|Permission                             | Use of Permission|
|---------------------------------------|----------------|
|android.permission.ACCESS_MEDIA_LOCATION |Access photos or images that may receive a watermark                                                                     |
|android.permission.INTERNET              |Used to pull news from development, icons for watermarking, and fonts                                                    |
|android.permission.READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE |Allow user to choose more images, also for a local database to keep user access (watching an add grants more temporarily)|
|android.permission.SYSTEM_ALERT_WINDOW   |Alert you when you're in the middle of adding watermarks but navigate to another screen without exporting                |
|android.permission.VIBRATE               |Notification usage in the future                                                                                         |
|android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE|Allows the user to save the newly watermarked image/photo.                                                               |

If you come across any issue, bug, or vulnerability, I would love to hear about it so we can get it fixed!  I'd also like to hear suggestions on how watermarkit can be improved!

Thanks for trying Watermarkit!
sincerely,
Justin
